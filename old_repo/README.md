# COMP0031-Model-Compression-on-Neural-Operator

This project focuses on model compression techniques applied to neural operators, particularly for efficient scientific computation tasks. 

---

## **Features**
- Implements various model compression techniques (e.g., quantization, pruning).
- Built with `neuraloperator`, a powerful library for neural operators.
- Includes examples on **Darcy Flow problems** and other PDE-based tasks.

---

## **Installation**
To get started, ensure you have Python installed and then install the necessary dependencies.

### **1. Install the primary dependency**
```bash
pip install neuraloperator
